&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic cystopathy (DCP) is one of the most common complications of late diabetes, and the incidence in diabetes patients is 19% ~ 84% [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_001_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b1Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_002_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b2Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. In late DCP, urinary tract infection and nephritis may occur and may develop into uremia [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_003_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_004_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b4Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. Many factors including decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, formation of oxidative free radicals, abnormal glucose metabolism, decrease of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduction of the supply of blood vessels can lead to the occurrence of DCP [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_005_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b5Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_006_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b6Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_007_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b7Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. However, the exact pathogenesis is still unclear. Recent studies have discovered a kind of specific cell type similar to the morphology of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the detrusor of humans, guinea pigs, and many other animals which is called bladder ICC [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_008_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b8Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_009_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b9Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]. Studies confirm that spontaneous detrusor contractions completely regulated by ICCs occur, and thus ICCs may be possible bladder pacemaker cells [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_010_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c10Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_011_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c11Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]. A tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit is present on the surface and cytoplasm of ICC cells and is considered to be a specific marker of ICC [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_012_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c12Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. The SCL gene is an important regulatory gene upstream of c-kit, and it mainly acts on the gene promoter of c-kit, thereby regulating c-kit expression [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_013_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c13Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]. For DCP patients, ICCs continue to shrink or disappear due to the induction of hyperglycemia, which can damage the transmission functions of the stem cell factor (SCF)/growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (c-kit) signaling pathway [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_014_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c14Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;], lead to the reduction of bladder sensation, increase urine storage capacity, decrease detrusor contractility during urination, increase bladder residual urine and other discomforts, and result in bladder function becoming completely paralyzed or even failing [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_015_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c15Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two key receptors on ICCs, the specific protein receptor c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF). The specific binding of c-kit and SCF can start the SCF / c-kit signaling pathway [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_016_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c16Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]. Research has shown that the stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene is an upstream necessary regulator of c-kit which can increase the expression of c-kit and then promote the recovery of the ICC phenotype and function in DCP [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_017_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c17Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]. Therefore, the SCF/c-kit signaling pathway plays a key role in promoting ICC function reversal, which can guide the clinical treatment of DCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recombinant lentiviral vectors containing human SCL gene can be used to infect ICC cells with morphological and functional damage to increase the number and promote the functional recovery of ICCs. In this study, recombinant lentiviral vectors containing the SCL gene were constructed using genetic engineering techniques and used to transfect &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cultured ICCs. The transfection efficiency and expression of the SCL gene were investigated. Our findings may provide new ideas for the further use of lentiviral vectors containing the human SCL gene in transfection experiments &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and DCP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-experimental-animals&#34;&gt;2.1 Experimental animals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 40 guinea pigs of either gender was used for the study. Their ages were 6-12 months and weight was 250-400 g. All guinea pigs were purchased from the Animal Experimental Center of Xinjiang Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical approval&lt;/strong&gt;: The research related to animals use has been complied with all the relevant national regulations and institutional policies for the care and use of animals. All animal experiments were conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-reagents&#34;&gt;2.2 Reagents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competent &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; DH5α, 293T cells, and GV287-EGFP vector were purchased from Genechem (Shanghai) Co. (Shanghai, China). DMEM medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA, US). RT-PCR kit was purchased from Fermentas Co.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;23-construction-and-identification-of-lentiviral-vectors-containing-the-human-scl-gene&#34;&gt;2.3 Construction and identification of lentiviral vectors containing the human SCL gene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recombinant lentiviral plasmid containing the human SCL gene was constructed by the assistance of Genechem (Shanghai) Co. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the human SCL gene was amplified by PCR. The primers were as follows: upstream 5’-GAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGGTCGCCACCAT-GACCGAGCGGCCGCCGAG-3’ and downstream 5’-TCAC-CATGGTGGCGACCGGCCGAGGGCCGGCTCCATC-3’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primers were synthesized by Genechem (Shanghai) Co. The PCR procedure was as follows: denaturing at 94oC for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94oC for 30 s, annealing at 55oC for 30 s, extension at 72oC for 2 min, and a final extension at 72oC for 10 min. The PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, the PCR product was purified and inserted into the GV287-EGFP vector by In-Fusion converting enzyme (QIAGEN Co., Valencia, CA, USA) to construct recombinant plasmid GV287-EGFP/SCL. The correctly constructed recombinant plasmid GV287-EGFP/SCL was identified by sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;24-packaging-of-lentiviral-vector-and-detection-of-virus-titer&#34;&gt;2.4 Packaging of lentiviral vector and detection of virus titer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1.5 mL sterile EP tube, 1.5 μg of packaging helper plasmids (Helper 1.0 and Helper 2.0, Genechem Co. Shanghai, China), 0.5 μg of expression plasmid, and 250 μL serum-free medium were added, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. At the same time, 9 μL of liposomes was mixed with 250 μL serum-free medium and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the above DNA solution and liposome suspension were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The 293T cell line was used as the packaging cell. The mixture of DNA and liposome was put into a 6-well plate and supplied with 1 mL complete medium. 293T cell suspension (1 ml) was put into the 6-well plate and incubated at 37oC in an atmosphere with CO2 for 48-72 h. After that, the cells were centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 20 minutes, and the precipitate was filtered. The lentivirus stock solution was filtered with PVDF membrane. Virus-containing medium were grouped by 1: 100 dilutions and divided into standard solution and test solution. Both solutions were used for transfecting 293T cells simultaneously, and the virus titer was calculated by a fluorescent labeling method [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_008_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2b8Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;25-in-vitro-culture-of-bladder-iccs-of-guinea-pigs&#34;&gt;2.5 &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; culture of bladder ICCs of guinea pigs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four healthy guinea pigs were randomly selected and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Their bladder tissues were removed in a sterile environment and cut into 1 mm3 pieces. The tissue pieces were digested with 1.0 mg/mL trypsin for 15 min at 37oC. DMEM medium (containing 1.0 mg/mL collagenase V, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin) was added, and the tissues were further digested for 90 min at 37oC. Then, the digested tissues were filtered and centrifuged at 350 xg for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with 1% phosphate buffer solution (PBS). It was then centrifuged at 350 xg three times for 5 min each. Single cells were suspended by pipetting and then seeded in a 6-well plate. Low glucose DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% double antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin) were added to each well, and the plate was then cultured at 37oC in an incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were observed under an inverted microscope, and the non-adhered smooth muscle cells were removed. The adhered ICCs were transferred to culture dishes and identified by immunofluorescence after 72 hours of incubation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;26-immunofluorescence&#34;&gt;2.6 Immunofluorescence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 6-well plate, a sterile slide was put into each well, and the ICC suspension was dropped on the center of the slide. About 1 mL medium was added to each well, and another 1 mL medium was added after 8 hours of incubation. After 48 hours of incubation, the slides were taken out. The primary (rat anti-mouse c-kit monoclonal antibody) and secondary antibody (FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat antibody) were diluted with antibody diluent to reach their working concentration 1: 100. The procedure of the immunohistochemical test was as follows: briefly, the slides were incubated in 100% acetone at room temperature for 10 minutes. After washing with 0.01 M PBS three times (5 minutes each time), the endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.03% H2O2 for 20 minutes at room temperature. Then, the slides were blocked with 1% FBS albumin for 30 minutes at room temperature. After blocking, the slides were incubated with primary antibody of rat anti-mouse c-kit monoclonal antibody (1: 100, Merck Millipore Co., Germany) in a wet box for 2 hours at room temperature and then for 48 hours at 4oC. After washing, FITC-labeled secondary antibody (rabbit anti-rat antibody, 1: 100, Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was added and incubated in the dark for 60 minutes. Finally, the slides were sealed with cover glass using 50% glycerol and observed under a fluorescence microscope and a laser scanning confocal microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;27-determination-of-the-optimal-moi-of-the-lentiviral-vector-containing-human-scl-gene-into-iccs&#34;&gt;2.7 Determination of the optimal MOI of the lentiviral vector containing human SCL gene into ICCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the manual for lentiviral transfection (provided by Genechem Co.), ICCs were added with 5×108 TU/mL lentiviral vectors containing the SCL gene at different MOIs (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0), and 10 μg/mL polybrene was simultaneously added. After incubation for 8-12 h, the cells were observed under a microscope. After another 48 h incubation, the growth of ICCs was observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope, and the transfection efficiency was calculated [Transfection efficiency = (Number of cells expressing GFP/Total cell number) × 100%] to determine the optimal MOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;28-determination-of-the-optimal-transfection-time-of-the-lentiviral-vector-containing-the-human-scl-gene-into-iccs&#34;&gt;2.8 Determination of the optimal transfection time of the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene into ICCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICCs were seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 3×104~5×104/mL. The ICCs were divided into a normal control group, blank plasmid control group, and lentivirus transfection group using a random number table method. In the normal control group, 1% PBS was added. In the blank plasmid control group, blank lentivirus was added. In the lentivirus transfection group, the lentiviral vector containing human SCL gene was added at the optimal MOI together with 10 μg/mL polybrene. After 24 hours of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 1% PBS twice, and then 1 mL fresh DMEM medium containing 10% FBS was added for further incubation. The cells were observed using the laser scanning microscope at the 2, 3, and 5 d after transfection. A total of 20 continuous perpendicular to the horizontal views (about 0.77 mm2/view, 200 ×) were observed. The optimal transfection time was determined by observing the expression intensity of GFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;29-rt-pcr&#34;&gt;2.9 RT-PCR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total RNA of ICCs was extracted at 2, 3, and 5 d after transfection, and the expression of SCL mRNA was analyzed using RT-PCR. The primers of SCL and GAPDH were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCL: Upstream: 5’-GAGGATCCCCGGTACCGGTCGC-CACCATGCGAGCGGCCGCCGAG-3’; Downstream: 5’-TCAC-CATGGTGGCGACCGACCGGCCGAGGGCCGGCTCCATC-3’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAPDH: Upstream: 5’-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3’; Downstream: 5’-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of SCL is 1036 bp, while that of GADPH is 456 bp. The PCR reaction procedure was as follows: denaturing at 94oC for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94oC for 30 s, annealing at 53oC for 30 s, and extension at 72oC for 1 min and a final extension at 72oC for 10 min. The products were detected with agarose gel electrophoresis. Gel imaging and gray intensity analysis were performed using a gel analysis system, and the expression of SCL mRNA in each group of ICCs was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;210-statistical-analysis&#34;&gt;2.10 Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data analysis was performed with the statistical software SPSS 17.0. The data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). ANOVA was used for the comparison among groups, and SNK-q test was used for the comparison between two groups. A &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-results&#34;&gt;3 Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-separation-culture-and-identification-of-guinea-pig-iccs&#34;&gt;3.1 Separation, culture and identification of guinea pig ICCs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm whether the cultured cells were ICCs, c-kit antibody was used to identify the ICCs. After 24 hours of seeding, some spindle cells were observed with both sides and had obvious convex. Their nuclei were large, and there were some black glycogen particles in the cytoplasm. They had regular shapes, and most of them grew adherently (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_fig_001_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b2b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Figure 1A)&lt;/a&gt;. After incubation for another 72 hours, the above cells were identified by immunofluorescence using the antibody of c-kit, which is an ICC-specific marker. The ICC-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (c-kit) was successfully expressed (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_fig_001_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b2b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Figure 1B)&lt;/a&gt;. This result verified that the cultured cells were ICCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GV287-SCL recombinant lentivirus vector was successfully constructed. The virus titer was 5 × 108 TU/ mL. To determine the optimal MOI for the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene to transfect cells, transfection efficiency of different MOI was measured. After 48 h of transfection, green fluorescence was observed under the laser scanning confocal microscope. As shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_fig_002_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b3b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;, when MOI was 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0, the transfection efficiencies were 35.42% ± 0.12%, 58.04% ± 2.28%, 74.47% ± 3.22%, 85.62% ± 0.33%, 90.39% ± 0.67%, 90.77 ± 0.40%, respectively. When MOI ≥ 10.0, the transfection efficiencies all maintained above 85%, and there were statistically significant differences from those at MOI &amp;lt; 10.0 (P &amp;lt; 0.05, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_tab_001_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b3b4Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). When MOI ≤ 10.0, the cell growth was good and had no cell death. When MOI ≥ 50.0, although the transfection efficiencies were high, part of the cells were dead, and the cell activity decreased. Taking into consideration the transfection efficiency and cell activity at each MOI value, the optimal MOI for the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene was determined to be 10.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the optimal transfection time for the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene to ICCs, comparison of the green fluorescence in ICCs at different days was performed. The bladder ICC-like cells were transfected at the optimal MOI, and the transfection efficiencies were observed at 2 d, 3 d, and 5 d after transfection (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_fig_003_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b4b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;). After 3 days of transfection, the green fluorescence was the most obvious with the highest intensity, and after that the expression of GFP was weakened. After 3 d of lentiviral transfection, GFP expression in the ICCs was higher than in ICCs with 2d and 5d of transfection. Hence, the optimal transfection time for the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene in ICCs was 3 d.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine whether the SCL gene was successfully introduced into ICCs, RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of mRNA in each group. The amplification product of the lentiviral group was consistent with the target fragment in size, while there was no expression of the specific band in the normal control group and blank plasmid control group (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_fig_004_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab1b2b5b3Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt;).

When the SCF/c-kit signaling pathway is successfully activated, the appearance and physiological characteristics of ICCs can be maintained [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_028_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c28Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. SCL is a transcription factor that can regulate the expression and function of c-kit, but it cannot bind to DNA directly [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_029_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c29Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. In the present study, the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene was constructed and transfected into &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; cultured ICCs. After transfection, the expression of SCL in ICCs was enhanced. These results may provide relevant information to further explore gene therapy for DCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, target cells were collected according to the adhesion time of bladder smooth muscle cells to bladder. After 24 h of incubation, ICCs were found to adhere to the culture plates, while bladder smooth muscle cells did not adhere. The non-adhered bladder muscle cells were filtered, and relatively pure bladder ICCs were obtained. Some characteristic spindle cells were observed under an inverted microscope. These cells had obvious convex branches on their sides, large nuclei, regular shapes, and were neatly adhered, while most of the non-adhered cells were oval, without projections on both poles and had overall flat shapes. The expression of the c-kit receptor was successful. Therefore, the cultured cells were confirmed to be bladder ICCs. The bladder ICCs obtained using this differential adherence method were of a relatively higher number and purer quality, but smooth muscle cells were still observed. This method is simple and time-cost effective and can provide enough cells for subsequent experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

Viral vectors have high transfection efficiencies for both dividing and non-dividing cells [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_034_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c34Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]. Thus, they are an ideal tool for gene transfection both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. In this study, lentivirus was packaged by a three plasmid system which included one recombinant virus plasmid encoding lentivirus and its two secondary packaging element vector plasmids. The encoding plasmid and the helper plasmids have cis-trans complementary functions. In addition, the structures of the secondary packaging plasmids were constructed by pHelper1.0 and pHelper2.0 vectors. This method is relatively simple, the lentivirus recombination rate and yield are acceptable, and the expression of the target gene is high. During the experiment, the supernatant rich in lentiviral particles was collected and concentrated and purified repeatedly to obtain high-titer lentiviral stock solution. The expression of the target gene was determined after transfecting 293T cells, and the virus titer was determined by fluorescence. The results showed that the titer of the lentivirus was 5 × 108 TU /mL, which could meet the needs of most transfection experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the toxic genes of lentivirus have been excluded, its biological risk is not completely lost. Lentivirus is a “suicide” virus with certain cytotoxicity [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_035_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c35Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_036_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c36Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;]. Studies have found that the transfection efficiency of lentivirus is closely related to its MOI, and high MOI can lead to some cell death [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_037_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c37Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_038_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c38Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_039_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c39Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/biol-2020-0010/html#j_biol-2020-0010_ref_040_w2aab3b7c51b1b6b1ab2b2c40Aa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]. Therefore, a proper MOI is important. In the current experiment, we found that the lentiviral transfection efficiency in ICCs was best at MOI = 10.0, and cell activity was good with no cell death. Considering the transfection efficiency and growth state of the cells, the optimal MOI value was determined to be 10.0. GFP is a bioluminescent protein that can steadily emit green fluorescence under the excitation of blue light and has no cytotoxicity. It is now widely used in cell biology and biopsy as a molecular marker or reporter gene. In this study, GFP was used as a marker gene of the lentivirus because of its stable and clear fluorescence. Under a fluorescence microscope, real-time and &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; observation of living cells can be realized. Therefore, the transfection of the three plasmids into 293T cells to generate virus could be observed in real time, and accurate and intuitive results could be obtained. The ICCs were transfected with the lentivirus at the optimal MOI value and the expression of GFP was observed under a confocal microscope. The results showed that there was no GFP expressions in the normal control group and blank plasmid control group after 2 days of transfection. The GFP expression intensity in ICCs after 3 days of lentivirus transfection was higher than that after 2 days and 5 days, so the optimal transfection time for the lentivirus containing the human SCL gene into ICCs was 3 days. Comprehensively, for the transfection of lentivirus containing the human SCL gene into ICCs, the optimal MOI was 10.0, and the transfection efficiency, biological activity, and safety were highest after 72 hours of transfection. The results of RT-PCR indicated that the amplification product in the lentivirus transfection group had the same size as that of the target fragment, which was 1036 bp, while there was no expression of the specific band in the normal control group and blank plasmid control group. This suggested that the SCL gene was successfully introduced into ICCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the present study. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; culture of cells is different from the body’s internal environment and might lose cell maintenance or auxiliary signals as well as interactions with other cells and proteins. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments cannot completely replicate the &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; situation, thus whether the transfection of DCP guinea pig bladder using a lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene or other &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments can obtain the same results needs further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this study successfully constructed a recombinant lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene by gene technology and molecular biological techniques. The titer of the lentivirus was 5 × 108 TU/ mL. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; cultured ICCs were transfected with the lentiviral vector containing the human SCL gene, and SCL was successfully expressed in the ICCs. Our findings may provide a foundation for further &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; transfection studies using the SCL gene.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Uyghur population; apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism; dyslipidemia; urolithiasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urolithiasis is a common urinary disease, with increasing incidence worldwide. The occurrence of urolithiasis varies among geographical regions and ethnic groups. A high incidence of urolithiasis has been observed in Xinjiang, China, particularly among the Uyghur population of south Xinjiang that follows a high-fat diet. High levels of blood lipids have been reported to affect lipid metabolism and may be a risk factor for urolithiasis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b1-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b2-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). Blood lipid levels are affected by genetic factors and lifestyle, and lipid metabolism processes are regulated by a set of genes. Different blood lipid levels have been detected among ethnic groups as early as childhood, which indicates that the differences may be based on genetic factors (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b3-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, genetic factors have been identified as a possible cause of a number of abnormalities in blood lipid metabolism (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b4-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). The present study focused on the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, which is one of the components of plasma lipoproteins. ApoE regulates blood lipid metabolism by binding with a receptor protein (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b5-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Epidemiological investigations have revealed that ApoE gene polymorphisms are closely associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b6-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ApoE is a major plasma lipoprotein that plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Lipoproteins with different ApoE isomers have been reported to exhibit distinct kinetic characteristics and affect the blood lipid levels differently (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b7-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;). Kong &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b8-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) reported that cholesterol crystallization in the gall bladder was associated with ApoE polymorphism, and hypothesized that ApoE may be a promoter of nucleation, and thus, a susceptibility factor for cholesterol crystallization in the gall bladder. In the present study, lipid metabolism was investigated in urolithiasis patients among the Uyghur population. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis, the associations between ApoE gene polymorphisms and lipid metabolism abnormalities were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials-and-methods&#34;&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subjects&#34;&gt;Subjects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 90 Uyghur patients with urolithiasis from the Aksu Prefecture, hospitalized between January and July 2007, were enrolled in this study (male, 51; female, 39; age range, 7–67 years). In addition, 90 healthy Uyghur individuals with no blood relation to the patients were randomly selected as the control group (male, 51; female, 39; age range, 8–69 years). Individuals from the control group had similar occupations and resided in the same area as the patient group individuals. B-type ultrasonography was performed to ensure that the control group did not suffer from a urinary calculus or any other relevant diseases. Patients diagnosed with a urinary calculus who did not undergo removal of the calculus, even following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, as well as patients with chronic urinary infections and renal insufficiency, were excluded from the study. Qualitative analysis of the calculus components was conducted using standard calculus qualitative analytical chemical reagents supplied by the Institute of Urology, Peking University (Peking, China). The reagents included calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, ammonium magnesium phosphate, uric acid, carbapatite, and cystine. The stone samples were powdered and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (Tensor 27; Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior written and informed consent was obtained from all the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Shihezi University (Shihezi, China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measurement-of-blood-lipid-profiles&#34;&gt;Measurement of blood lipid profiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood lipids levels were analyzed on an Olympus AU400 Automated Chemistry analyzer (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Blood samples were collected from the peripheral vein of each individual without fasting and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of frozen serum were thawed on ice for 2 h. The samples were thus frozen and thawed twice in total. Lipid metabolites were extracted from 100 μl of serum. Blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were analyzed in the patients and control groups using the cholesterol oxidase method. In addition, the levels of apolipoprotein A-I and total lipoprotein were determined by an immunoturbidimetric assay. The levels of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein were measured using a routine Hitachi 7600 autoanalyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pcr-rflp-analysis&#34;&gt;PCR-RFLP analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 5-ml blood sample was collected from the peripheral vein of each individual and was anticoagulated with EDTA. DNA was extracted from the blood sample using a Genomic DNA Extraction kit (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ApoE gene was amplified in a total volume of 30 μl. The primerswere synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. and their sequences as follows: forward: 5′-ACA GAA TTC GCC CCG GCC TGG TAC AC-3′ and reverse: 5′-TAA GCT TGG CAC GGC TGT CCA AGG A-3′. Each PCR cycle included 3 μl 10X PCR buffer (with 15 mM MgCl2), 2 units &lt;em&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt; DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), 2 μl dNTP (2.5 mM), 0.4 μl each of the forward and reverse primers (20 mM) and 0.5–0.6 μg DNA templates. The following PCR procedure was used: initial denaturation at 97°C for 7 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 45 sec; annealing at 65°C for 45 sec and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR was performed in a C1000 Touch™ PCR thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following PCR, a 1-μg sample of the ApoE gene amplification product was digested with 20 μl restriction endonuclease (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.). Following digestion, the DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel for 2 h at 90 V. The genotypes were identified using a Gel Doc™ XR gel imaging and analysis system (Bio-Rad). A sample was randomly selected from each genotype identified during the RFLP analysis, and sequenced by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statistical-analysis&#34;&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequencies of the genotypes and gene alleles were calculated separately in the patient and control groups using a gene counting method as described previously (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b9-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;). The data were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The genotypic and allelic differences between the control and patient groups were examined with the χ2 test, where P&amp;lt;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-of-calculus-composition&#34;&gt;Analysis of calculus composition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the percentage of each component in the calculi of the patients, calculus composition was analyzed using standard calculus qualitative analytical chemical reagents. The results indicated that the major component of the calculi was calcium oxalate in 90.0% of the patients (81/90). Among the 81 patients with calcium oxalate calculi, the calculus composition detected was as follows: Pure calcium oxalate (67.9%, 55/81); calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (4.9%, 4/81); calcium oxalate and ammonium magnesium phosphate (2.5%, 2/81); calcium oxalate and uric acid or ammonium urate (18.5%, 15/81); calcium oxalate, ammonium magnesium phosphate and dahllite (2.5%; 2/81); calcium oxalate and dahllite (2.5%, 2/81); and calcium oxalate and cystine (1.2%, 1/81). Among the other nine urolithiasis cases, the calculus composition included pure calcium phosphate (2.2%, 2/90), pure uric acid (5.6%, 5/90) and pure ammonium magnesium phosphate (2.2%, 2/90). These results indicated that the major component of calculi in urolithiasis cases among the Uyghur population of south Xinjiang was calcium oxalate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;number-of-cases-with-abnormal-levels-of-total-cholesterol-triglycerides-and-high-density-lipoproteins-is-higher-in-urolithiasis-patients&#34;&gt;Number of cases with abnormal levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins is higher in urolithiasis patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood lipid levels were measured to investigate the role of blood lipids in urolithiasis. The blood lipids detected included total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, apolipoprotein A-I and lipoproteins. As shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/table/tI-etm-09-01-0183/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Table I&lt;/a&gt;, abnormal levels of total cholesterol were detected in 38 urolithiasis patients (42.2%) and 21 individuals from the control group (23.3%). In addition, abnormal levels of triglycerides were observed in 33 patients (36.7%) and 15 cases from the control group (16.7%). In total, 29 cases (32.2%) in the patient group exhibited abnormal levels of high-density lipoproteins, whereas abnormal levels were detected in only 16 cases from the control group (17.8%). Abnormal levels of apolipoprotein A-I were detected in 67 cases (74.4%) in the patient group and 60 cases (66.7%) in the control group. The number of cases exhibiting abnormal levels of low-density lipoproteins was 57 in the patient group (63.3%) and 53 in the control group (58.9%). Only one case (1.1%) was detected with abnormal levels of lipoproteins in the patient group, while no cases were detected in the control group. Statistically, the number of cases with abnormal levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins was significantly higher in the patient group when compared with the control group. However, the difference in the number of cases with abnormal levels of apolipoprotein A-I, low-density lipoproteins and lipoproteins between the two groups was not found to be statistically significant. These results indicated that dyslipidemia may be a significant factor in the development of urolithiasis among the Uyghur population of south Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;associations-between-apoe-gene-polymorphisms-and-the-occurrence-of-urolithiasis&#34;&gt;Associations between ApoE gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of urolithiasis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the associations between the polymorphisms of ApoE and the occurrence of urolithiasis, ApoE gene polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR-RFLP. The ApoE gene was successfully amplified in the 180 subjects (90 patients and 90 controls) and the product size of the gene was 244 bp. In theory, due to the presence of different bases at sites 112 and 158 of the ApoE gene, three alleles and six genotypes can be generated following digestion with the Hha I restriction endonuclease. However, in this study, only three genotypes were identified in the subjects, namely, the E3/3, E4/4 and E3/4 genotypes (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/figure/f1-etm-09-01-0183/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/a&gt;). Through Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing, these genotypes of ApoE were found to be consistent with the theoretical expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Following digestion with the restriction endonuclease, Hha I, the DNA fragments were run on a polyacrylamide gel and the representative electrophoresis results of the E3/4 (91, 72 and 48 bp), E3/3 (91 and 48 bp) and E4/4 (72 and 48 bp) genotypes are shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associations between ApoE gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of urolithiasis were analyzed. As shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/table/tII-etm-09-01-0183/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Table II&lt;/a&gt;, 28 cases with E3/3 (30.1%), 58 cases with E3/4 (64.4%) and four cases with the E4/4 genotype (4.5%) were detected in the patient group. By contrast, 52 individuals with E3/3 (57.8%), 35 individuals with E3/4 (38.9%) and three individuals with the E4/4 genotype (3.3%) were identified in the control group. The frequency of the E3/4 genotype in the patient group was significantly higher when compared with the control group (χ2=12.96; P&amp;lt;0.001). The number of E3 and E4 alleles in the patient group was 114 (64.8%) and 62 (35.2%), respectively, while the number of these alleles in the control group was 139 (79.0%) and 41 (21.0%), respectively. Statistically, the frequency of the E4 allele in the patient group was significantly higher when compared with the control group (χ2=6.61; P&amp;lt;0.025). The results indicated that the E3/4 genotype and E4 allele may be susceptibility factors for urolithiasis among the Uyghur population of south Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of urolithiasis has been shown to increase with age and the increasing incidence of obesity (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b10-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to the high risk of developing obesity, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia and abnormal glucose tolerance, individuals with metabolic syndromes also experience a high risk of urolithiasis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b11-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;). Zhang (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b12-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;) reported that high levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol and ApoE in the blood were risk factors for developing urolithiasis. Clinical control of urolithiasis may relieve the symptoms, promote the removal of calculi, lower the risk of recurrence and reduce the effect on the kidneys. Accordingly, the present study revealed that the levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins and cholesterol were significantly higher in the urolithiasis patient group when compared with the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous study demonstrated that ApoE polymorphisms were associated with human longevity in a Han Chinese population (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b13-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). In the current study, however, the association between ApoE polymorphisms and the age of the patients was not analyzed. In another study, the allele frequencies of the ApoE polymorphism in Zambian populations were 13.8, 59.5 and 26.7% for the E2, E3 and E4 alleles, respectively (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247315/#b14-etm-09-01-0183&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;). Genotype frequencies of E3/3 were 32.8% in Zambian populations. The allele and genotype frequencies in Uyghur populations were different to those in Zambian populations. This may be due to the difference in ethnic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the polymorphisms of ApoE were investigated among the Uyghur population of south Xinjiang using PCR-RFLP analysis. The number of cases with the E3/4 genotype was significantly higher in the patient group when compared with the control group (χ2=12.96; P&amp;lt;0.001). In addition, the number of cases with the E4 allele was significantly higher in the patient group when compared with the control group (χ2=6.61; P&amp;lt;0.025). Therefore, the E4 allele of the ApoE gene may be used as a potential indicator in the diagnosis and screening of urolithiasis.&lt;/p&gt;
